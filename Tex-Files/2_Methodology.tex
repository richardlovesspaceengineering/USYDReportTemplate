\section{Methodology} \label{sec:methodology}

% Here you should give an overview of HOW you completed the analysis. A summary of how the analysis was conducted with subsections for those parts that require more
% details. You should make clear what your nomenclature is if it is critical for the reader to understand the rest of the report (e.g. the station designations for the engine). If you
% will refer to this throughout the report you should consider using a figure.

% For your propeller assignment I would expect:
% - A brief description of the wind tunnel experiments
% - A concise summary of the blade element analysis and what you introduced to deal with small propellers (e.g. the Xfoil airfoil results)
% - How you matched the propeller and the engine
% - How you matched the propeller/engine combination with the aircraft

% This needs to be concise and descriptive. Equations are only necessary if you did something non-standard. If you make this section too verbose you will run out of space to put the results!!
